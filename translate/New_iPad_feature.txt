Is Apple turning the iPad Pro into a hybrid laptop competing with the Surface Pro?
iPad Pro will support more peripheral devices such as mouse and trackpad to increase flexibility in use.

Recently, Irish developer and host Steve Troughton-Smith, who posted the Twitter section, revealed some very important information for iPad Pro users.
They mentioned that iOS 13 will support mouse and trackpad for Apple's high-end tablet line of iOS. This makes it easier for iPad Pro to run multitasking, turning tablets into an alternative to laptops.
Apple does not want iPad Pro users to stop using the touch screen, but they do so to give users another option to use their iPad Pro.
Most likely, the mouse will connect to the tablet via USB-C ports on iPad Pro 2018. If Apple supports the mouse and trackpad for iPad Pro 2018, this will be a great opportunity for accessory vendors. .

Some people ask that whether Apple does so has a big impact on their Macbook line.
According to some recent information, Apple is trying to create a unified set of applications that can be used on iPhone, iPad and Mac in 2021.

This shows that Apple will soon replace Intel's microprocessor running on a Mac with chips designed by itself. However, iOS is still iOS and macOS remains the same platform for a computer.

iPad Pro will compete in the high-end tablet market with Microsoft's Surface Pro 6, not a hybrid laptop.
