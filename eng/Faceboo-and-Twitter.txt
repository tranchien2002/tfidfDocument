Facebook and Twitter are once again under fire from Congress for allegedly suppressing the views of conservatives.

The tech giants faced accusations from the Senate on Wednesday, a day after Facebook and Google attended another high-profile hearing over the spread of white nationalism on their platforms.
This isn't the first time tech platforms have been accused of anti-conservative bias. Last September, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey were questioned by GOP lawmakers about a perceived left-leaning agenda. Google CEO Sundar Pichai was also invited to appear, but he declined the invitation. When Pichai did finally testify in December, he too was accused of stifling conservative voices.

President Donald Trump has also criticized the tech giants for political bias. Last August, he complained that Google was suppressing his message by not promoting his State of the Union speech (which turned out to be untrue). He also said that search results for news associated with him was "rigged."

"Google and Twitter and Facebook, they're really treading on very, very troubled territory," Trump said. "And they have to be careful."
